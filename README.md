# GDCursorLock

Just build and run the application and it automatically locks your mouse cursor to Geometry Dash. When your cursor runs of the screen it will be reset to the middle of the screen. This happens only if Geometry Dash is currently the focused application window, which means you can always Alt-Tab out of your game.
